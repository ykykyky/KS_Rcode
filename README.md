# Prediction of potential therapeutic drugs for sepsis





## Project introduction

The project uses sepsis gene expression profile data in GEO and small molecule compound perturbation data in LINCS to screen compounds that may have therapeutic effects on sepsis.



## Project structure

* src is a code for differential expression analysis, construction of disease labels and calculation of treatment scores.

* The result contains the differentially expressed genes obtained from the data set through differential expression analysis, the respective disease tags of each dataset, and the final ordered drug list of each dataset.
